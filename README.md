📊 Vendor Performance – End-to-End Data Analytics Project

SQL + Python | Complete EDA | Advanced Data Cleaning | LFS-Handled Large Datasets

This project is a full end-to-end vendor performance analysis built using MySQL + Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
It follows real company-standard workflow, including database exploration, data cleaning, deep EDA, and data visualisation.


🗂️ Project Overview
✔️ What I Did in This Project

    -> Performed SQL-based initial EDA on raw purchase, sales, inventory, and vendor invoice datasets.

    ->Created clean, merged, and aggregated tables for deep analysis.

    ->Conducted advanced EDA in Python, including:

    ->Summary statistics

    ->Outlier analysis

    ->Missing value handling

    ->Feature engineering

    ->Data type corrections

    ->Distribution analysis

    ->Correlation heatmaps

    ->Time-based purchase & sales patterns

  Created multiple visualisations to understand purchase behaviour, vendor performance, and product movement.

✔️ Skills Demonstrated

    ->SQL Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions

    ->Python (Pandas) for data cleaning & wrangling

    ->Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for visual insights

    ->Working with large datasets using Git LFS

  End-to-end project workflow similar to real industry analytics


🔍 EDA Highlights (Python)
🔹 Distribution Analysis

    ->Histograms & boxplots for purchase quantity, sales quantity, price, margins

    ->Detected outliers due to high-value purchases & premium products

🔹 Summary Statistics & Data Quality Checks

    ->Found negative gross profit (loss)

    ->Found invalid profit-margin values due to division by zero

    ->Fixed inconsistent data types (e.g., volume as a string)

🔹 Correlation Heatmap

    ->Strong correlation between purchase qty ↔ sales qty

    ->Helps evaluate inventory movement efficiency
    
🔹 Vendor Performance Indicators

    ->Total purchase value by vendor

    ->Average purchase price trends

    ->Top & bottom-performing vendors

    ->Vendor-wise product movement

📊 Visualisations Included

    ->Histograms

    ->Box Plots

    ->Heatmap

    ->Vendor-wise purchase analysis

    ->Product performance distribution

    ->Outlier detection graphs

    ->Time-based purchase trends

  (All visuals are generated in Python using Pandas, Matplotlib & Seaborn.)
